#CDA channel From HTTPS with XSL Output

## Purpose

The majority of this project is covered under the CDA tutorial on iNTERFACEWARE's [site](http://wiki.interfaceware.com/915.html), 
which has the XML output of a minimal CDA (HL7 v3) file. This project also has added bits from their Tips and Tricks [section](http://wiki.interfaceware.com/905.html)
which allows the XSL file to also be served from the same channel, making the CDA more human-readable and, therefore, more REST-friendly.

## Project Import

The [project_import] folder contains the project zip file that can be imported into an Iguana instance.
